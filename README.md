These are the files for a functional social media website I made as a project in my database class in BU. This website uses a python backend, specifically using flask as the framework. SQL is used for the database, and the schema can also be found in the files. 

This was meant to be a group project but both my partners left the group (one dropped the class, the other hopped on to another group) before the project started, so this was all done by me. I may not have had the time to fully finish it before having to submit it, but between dealing with all my other classes and doing 3x the workload I would've been doing if I had good partners, I'm proud of it as it is.
