# PhotoSharing
These are the files for a functional social media website I made as a project in my database class in BU, CS460 Database Management Systems. This website uses a python backend, specifically using flask as the framework. SQL is used for the database, and the schema can also be found in the files. 

This was meant to be a group project but both my partners left the group (one dropped the class, the other hopped on to another group) before the project started, so this was all done by me. I may not have had the time to fully finish it before having to submit it, but between dealing with all my other classes and doing 3x the workload I would've been doing if I had good partners, I'm proud of it as it is. 

This was also the last project I did before my first ever laptop breathed its last breath (a very very loud last breath as the internal fan was scraping against plastic) so it's double sentimental.

## Running the Website
You'll need:
- MySQL installed 
- Python with Flask (see requirements.txt) installed - use a dedicated python version manager to make this less messy
  
Steps:
- Open MySQL and run the .sql schema file - have SQL as a service running while the app is.
- Run app.py with python through the command line, making sure you're using the proper python environment.
- Open localhost to connect to the website.
